    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Calystone may request permissions to read, edit, and save your files when you opt to connect it with third-party cloud services. Use of these third-party services is governed by each provider’s terms and policies (e.g. OneDrive and Dropbox).</p>
    <p>Calystone is not responsible for any actions or omissions by third-party services. Your use of third-party services is at your own risk.</p>
