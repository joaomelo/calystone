# Contributing to Calystone

While I'm passionate about this project, I maintain it alongside my full-time job and family commitments. To ensure sustainable development and maintain mental health, I've decided to keep the project code closed to external contributions for now. So, i am not accepting code contributions (PRs) at this time.

If you found a bug, please open a bug report using the issues form. The GitHub discussion feature is also enabled with focus on questions around how to use the app features.
