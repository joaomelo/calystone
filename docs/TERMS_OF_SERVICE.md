By accessing or using Calystone ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, you may not use Calystone. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access Calystone.

## Description of Calystone
Calystone is an open-source, self-management application that integrates with the local file systems via the File System Access API and third-party file services (OneDrive and Dropbox)

Calystone does not have its own backend or database and does not store any personal user data or files on any servers controlled by Calystone.

## Third-Party Services
Calystone may request permissions to read, edit, and save your files when you opt to connect it with third-party cloud services. Use of these third-party services is governed by each provider's terms and policies (e.g. OneDrive and Dropbox).

Calystone is not responsible for any actions or omissions by third-party services. Your use of third-party services is at your own risk.

## User Responsibilities
You are responsible for granting the permissions required by Calystone to access files on your local system or cloud storage. You may revoke these permissions at any time using the relevant settings in your browser or third-party service.

You are fully responsible for maintaining and backing up your own files. Calystone does not store or back up any of your files on its own servers.

You agree to use Calystone in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

## Data Ownership and Privacy
You retain all rights, title, and interest in and to your files. Calystone does not claim any ownership over user files.

Please review our Privacy Policy for details on how Calystone accesses or uses data from third-party services and your local file system. By using Calystone, you consent to the practices described therein.

## Disclaimer of Warranties
Calystone is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind. Calystone is in continuous development and may not be fully stable or functional at any point.

Calystone disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

Calystone makes no warranties regarding third-party services or files accessed through the App.

## Limitation of Liability
Under no circumstances shall Calystone, its contributors, or maintainers be liable for any loss of data, damage to your files, or any other damages or liability arising from your use of the App or third-party services.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Calystone and its contributors shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, nor any loss of profits or revenues.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of liability for certain types of damages. In such jurisdictions, Calystone's liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

## Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Calystone, its contributors, and maintainers from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of Calystone, your violation of these Terms and your violation of any third-party right, including intellectual property or privacy rights

## Modifications to the Terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. When we do, we will post the revised Terms with an updated "Effective Date."

Your continued use of Calystone after any such changes have been posted indicates your acceptance of the new Terms.

## Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Calystone's primary maintainers reside, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising under these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction.
