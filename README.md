# Calystone

A web self-management app based on your file system.

# Self-management

Your file structure is already a personally curated organization system. In it, you can represent life areas and projects. The app allows users to integrate self-management activities directly into that structure.

The first feature is note-taking. The intention is to easily edit and search your text notes with the file system outline at a glance, allowing easy switching between projects.

After establishing the note-taking capability, the intention is to implement task management and calendar features using text files to represent to-do items.

# File system

Our directories and files are the ultimate personal database. We own that data and can control what to share or delete. 

You can move them to any operational system, and if the file format is open, like text files, you can edit them with your app of choice without worrying about what will happen to your data if the app is deprecated.

File systems are also excellent abstractions of how we organize our lives. In a personal project, like a trip, for example, we deal with multiple types of data, like pictures, spreadsheets, and plans. A folder can accommodate all of that so we can make a mental model of the task we are dealing with.

The Calystone app tries to take advantage of that and offers features over our file systems.

# Privacy

The app does not collect any data. It does not use cookies or any tracking methodology. The file's content is kept on your machine. 

Permissions are controlled by the user's browser as specified in the [File System API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API).

# Contributions

This project is open source. You are welcome to run, copy, distribute, and study the software.

Regarding contributions, I have a daytime job and a wonderful family to assist. So I code in the gaps presented late nights and weekends. To manage that scarcity and my mental health, I decided to keep the project closed to contributions for now.
